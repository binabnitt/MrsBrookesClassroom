<h2>A Little Bit About Me </h2>
<p><strong><em>Hello!  Welcome to the Pulaski Elementary's Library Webpage!</strong></em> I hope you find the information presented on this page to be helpful!  
A little bit about me...I am going to school to become a Librarian at Eastern Kentucky University.  I am attending my last class where I 
am learning how to create webpages!  Finding out how to use html has been kinda difficult but I am not one to give up easily!  I hope to
teach you many things that I have learned from this class to help you navigate the wonderful world wide web!  
<br>
I am married to my husband, Tyrel.  Together we have three pretty amazing children.  We love to camp, hike, and go boating on the beautiful
Lake Cumberland...oh, and I LOVE to read!!  </body> </p>
